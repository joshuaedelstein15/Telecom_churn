    "# Telecom Churn Analysis\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Most telecom companies suffer from voluntary churn(loss of customers to a competition). Churn rate has strong impact on the life time value of the customer because it affects the length of service and the future revenue of the company. For example if a company has 25% churn rate then the average customer lifetime is 4 years; similarly a company with a churn rate of 50%, has an average customer lifetime of 2 years. It is estimated that 75 percent of the 17 to 20 million subscribers signing up with a new wireless carrier every year are coming from another wireless provider, which means they are churners. Telecom companies spend hundreds of dollars to acquire a new customer and when that customer leaves, the company not only loses the future revenue from that customer but also the resources spent to acquire that customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Telecom companies have used two approaches to address churn - (a) Untargeted approach and (b) Targeted approach. The untargeted approach relies on superior product and mass advertising to increase brand loyalty and thus retain customers. The targeted approach relies on identifying customers who are likely to churn, and  provide suitable intervention to encourage them to stay.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",

    "\n",
    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "SyriaTel is a smaller end wireless provider, they don't have such the budget to invest in a large scale advertising campaign. However, they also can't afford to keep losing customers. Therefore they have turned to us to create a model for predicting which customers will churn. When a customers has been determined as likely to churn they will contact the customer with promotional deals in hopes of keeping the customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario we will break the data into 2 categories: 1) the columns used to predict churn, 2) the target column of whether the customers churned or not. If churn is \"True\" that means the customer churned, and \"False\" if the customer didn't churn. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general it is important to consider beforehand whether a false positive or false negative is worse. In each specific case one should tune their model based on what is more important. In our case a false positive means that we predicted the customer would churn when they didn't. The outcome of this is that we will send them some promotional deals, and perhaps give them a discount. This will in turn cause a slight loss of profit, as these clients were already happy paying full price. On the other hand, a false negative is when we predict that a customer won't churn when really they will. This means that we will lose a customer without ever sending them promotional deals to try to get them to stay. The loss from this mistake is far greater then the loss from a false positive. As such when we are creating models we will attempt to minimize false negatives(maximize recall) as much as possible."

This is interesting to note, and perhaps could require further research why specifically day minutes and charges have a large affect then eve or night minutes.\n",

These indicate how many calls the customer makes internationally and if they have an international plan in the first place.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "We will now sum up our findings from our analysis and modeling:\n",
    "1. Model Type:\n",
    "- Bagging Classifier-  which is short for Bootstrap Aggregating, is a modeling method that creates multiple versions of a base model on different subsets of the training data and combines their predictions. The samples are created by using random sampling techniques that involve selecting samples with replacement. The base estimator for each smaller model was a Decision Tree.\n",
    "2. Model Scoring:\n",
    "- Accuracy score 93% \n",
    "- F1-score of .79\n",
    "- Precision of 73%\n",
    "- Recall of 85%\n",
    "3. Model Choice:\n",
    "- Firstly, we can see the tremendous improvement in all areas of our final model to our baseline model. Especially in terms of recall and f1-score the model improved from 18% to 85% and from .27 to .79, respectively.\n",
    "- Although we had other models with slightly higher accuracy and f1-scores, we chose this model as it had the highest recall without compromising the accuracy or f1-score too much.\n",
    "4. Feature Importance:\n",
    "- The first two most important features were: `total day minutes` and `total day charge`. This signals to SyriaTel to pay more attention to daytime minutes and charge vs eve or night of the same metrics.\n",
    "- The next most imporant feature was: `customer service calls`. This was the most expected as the physical dealings that the clients have with SyriaTel will have an impact on whether they are satisfied or not.\n",
    "- The fourth and fifth most important features were: `total intl calls` and `international plan yes`. This indicates that SyriaTel should focus more of their energy on their international services.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations\n",
    "We recommend that SyriaTel use the model to preemptively reach out to predicted churn customers and offer some sort of promotional offer, in hopes of getting them to stay with them. Additional recommendations would be to further invest in their customer service, as well as service for international plans. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "The limitations on this model is that it was produced and testing on not such a large amount of data. In that 667 clients in the large scheme of things is not very significant. Although it may take more time and resources, the model should be re trained with a larger dataset to test its validity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "Moving forward we will offer a few possible steps to SyriaTel:\n",
    "1. Collect more data to create a more valid model\n",
    "2. Run metrics on the most important features to see what makes them the most impactful, and then use that information to their benefit.\n",
    "3. Analyze which methods are best to prevent customer churn. We could compare the affect of offering coupons vs gift cards vs discounts or other incentives to stay. We can also look into methods to create brand loyalty and the cost vs return on such things. To see if SyriaTel can indeed afford these things."
